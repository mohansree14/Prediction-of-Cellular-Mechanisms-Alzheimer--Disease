# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis, visualization, and exploration of single-cell RNA sequencing data.

## How to Use

1. **Install dependencies:**
   - Run `pip install -r ../requirements.txt` from the project root.
2. **Launch Jupyter:**
   - Run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` in this directory.
3. **Open a notebook:**
   - Start with `01_detailed_analysis.ipynb` for a comprehensive analysis template.

## Typical Workflow
- Data loading and exploration
- Quality control and filtering
- Feature extraction and engineering
- Visualization (distributions, heatmaps, clustering, cell types)
- Advanced analysis (clustering, cell type annotation, differential expression)

## Tips
- For large datasets, use chunked loading or sampling for speed.
- Save figures to the `results/figures/` directory for publication-ready outputs.
- Document your analysis steps for reproducibility.
